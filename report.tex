\abstract{
	In preparation for the experiments at AWAKE, simulations were used to
	determine to what precision the spectrometer is to be able to measure the
	emittance of the accelerated electron beam. A range of experimental
	parameters, including bunch size, energy, energy spread, emittance were
	tested and the degree to which these parameters effect the measurement of
	the emittance were determined. Systematic errors arising from the discrete
	pixels on the screen were found to increase the measurement emittance by
	\SI{1e-8}{\meter\radian}.
