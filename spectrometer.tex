\label{sec:spectrometer}

There are two main goals the spectrometer is expected to fulfill. The first is
to measure the mean energy and energy spread of the beam as it is this
measurement that determines the success of the AWAKE project, i.e.  whether or
not the electrons were accelerated up to the desired
\SI{10}{\giga\electronvolt} displaying large EM gradients of
\SI{1}{\giga\volt\per\meter}.

second goal to measure quality and shape of the beam

\subsection{Design}

dipole used to separate the electrons from the protons and generate a spread of
electrons in

quadrupole doublet focuses the beam in a particular energy. this increases the
particle density on the screen improving the signal to noise ratio.

due to large amounts of radiation, the CCD camera (Andor iStar 340T) is located
17~m from the tunnel. light will be reflected onto the camera using a series of
mirrors
