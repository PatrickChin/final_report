\label{sec:spectrometer}

There are two main goals the spectrometer is expected to fulfill. The first is
to measure the mean energy and energy spread of the beam as is it this
measurement of the mean energy that determines the success of the AWAKE project,
whether or not the electrons were accelerated up to the desired
\SI{10}{\giga\electronvolt}.
