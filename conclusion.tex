\subsection{Errors}
\label{sub:errors}

Despite accpeting the error bars for many of the graphs, it is still likely that
the calculation of the errors are wrong. Looking at the output files of
simulations with very large backgrounds, it is clear that the error bars do not
take into account the large statistical fluctuations about the expected beam
size. The calculation of errors in the simulation is well understood appart from
the calculation of the error of the \(\chi^2\) fitted parameters.
