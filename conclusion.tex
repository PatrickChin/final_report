\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The effect of three different experimental parameters were investigated, and
the ranges between which the emittance measurements were accurate and reasonably
precice were found. Despite the fact that the error measurements were
misscalculated, these can be infered from the spread of these measurements.
So the behaviour of the emittance measurement with respect to these parameters
have been presented.

There still remains many possible combinations of these parameters to be
investigated. For example at higher backgrounds, the range of percentage energy
spreads where an emittance measurement would be reliable is likely to shift. For
this reason, the expected values for all other parameters that were not being
investigated were used.
