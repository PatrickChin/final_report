\subsection{Single Particle Dynamics}

When working with beams of particles, it is advantageous to work in the
coordinate system that follows the ideal path of the beam, denoting this axis
with \(z\). A particle's state can be described with the coordinates \((u, u')\)
that lie in what is known as phase space, where \(u\) is a plane transverse to
the direction of the propagating beam, either \(x\) or \(y\), and \(u'\) is the
transverse velocity of the particle in the \(u\) plane.  If the beam's motion in
the these transverse planes are independent, that is, we ignore transverse
coupling terms, a particle's motion in each plane can be described by
\begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		u(z) \\ u'(z)
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
		C_u(z)  & S_u(z)  \\
		C'_u(z) & S'_u(z)
	\end{pmatrix}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		u_0 \\ u'_0
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where the functions \(C_u(z)\), \(S_u(z)\), \(C'_u(z)\) and \(S'_u(z)\),
describe the effect the beam line has on the position and divergence of an
individual particle. Using this system of matricies, drift and quadrupole
matricies can be derived~\cite{wiedemann2007particle} where the drift matrix is
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{M}_D(l) =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		1 & l \\
		0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
	\label{eq:drift}
\end{equation}
the matrix of a focusing quadrupole of length \(l\) and strength \(k\) is
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{M}_{QF}(l) =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos\varphi & \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\sin\varphi \\
		-\sqrt{k}\sin\varphi & \cos\varphi
	\end{pmatrix}
	\label{eq:qf}
\end{equation}
where \(\varphi = \sqrt{kl}\). The matrix of a defocusing quadrupole is
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{M}_{QD}(l) =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cosh\varphi & \frac{1}{\sqrt{\abs{k}}}\sinh\varphi \\
		-\sqrt{\abs{k}}\sinh\varphi & \cosh\varphi
	\end{pmatrix}
	\label{eq:qd}
\end{equation}
where \(\varphi = \sqrt{\abs k}l\).

These transport matricies can be multiplied together resulting in the
transformation matrix representing all the components of a beamline, making it
simple to follow a particle down a transport line.

\subsection{Emittance}

	\label{fig:ellipse}
\end{figure}

Grouping the individual particles of a beam, they will occupy an area in phase
space known as the emittance.  Qualitatively the emittance of a beam is a
measure of how parallel the particles of the beam are to each other and is a
conserved quantity while the beam is not being acted upon by external forces.

In phase space the beam of particles will usually take up an area resembling
that of an ellipse. This is because, after a diverging or converging beam has
traveled through an aperture, we expect particles that are further away from the
centre of the beam to have a larger transverse momentum. This is unless the beam
is being measured at it's waist where it is transitioning between converging and
diverging or visa versa. Figure~\ref{fig:ellipse} shows the projection of a
beam, diverging in the \(x\) direction, onto the two dimensional \(x\) phase
space.  A line in the shape of an ellipse is drawn such that it encompases
\SI{95}{\percent} of all the particles in the beam~\cite{buon1994beam}, this is
called the phase ellipse.  The emittance is defined by the area of this ellipse
divided by \(\pi\) in units of \si{\meter\radian}. Note that in general, the
transverse momenta, hence the slope of the particles in the beam, are very small
so the approximation \(\sin u'\approx u'\) can be used.
% TODO explain angle or transverse momentum on y axis in phase space

% \begin{equation}
% 	\int_{\text{ellipse}}\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}x' =\pi\epsilon
% \end{equation}

The general equation of an ellipse can be used to describe the phase ellipse:
\begin{equation}
	\gamma x^2 + 2\alpha xx' + \beta x'^2 = \epsilon
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha\),  \(\beta\), \(\gamma\) and \(\epsilon\) are ellipse parameters
that determine the ellipse's shape and orientation in phase space.  The area of
the ellipse \(\epsilon\) is defined as the emittance~\footnote{Often, the units
of \(\pi\) are omitted and the emittance is given in units of
\si{\pi\;\meter\;\radian}.}. Of the four beam parameters, only three are
independent, and since \(\epsilon\) is defined as the area, the other three can
be found to be correlated from the ellipse's geometric properties by
\begin{equation}
	\beta\gamma - \alpha^2 = 1
\end{equation}

A matrix describing the beam, the beam matrix, has been derived using the
matirix representation of the ellipse. The beam matrix allows the whole beam to
be transported via the transport matricies in (\ref{eq:drift}), (\ref{eq:qd})
and (\ref{eq:qf})~\cite{wiedemann2007particle}. This beam matrix is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\bm{\sigma} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} \\
		\sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\epsilon
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\beta & -\alpha \\
		-\alpha & \gamma \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where each element describes distributions of particles in the beam as follows:
\begin{align}
	\sigma_{11} &= \langle x_i^2 \rangle = \epsilon\beta \\
	\sigma_{22} &= \langle {x'}_i^2 \rangle = \epsilon\gamma \\
	\sigma_{12} &= \langle x_i x'_i \rangle = -\epsilon\alpha
\end{align}

The evolution of this matrix along the beam transport line can then be
calculated by applying the transport matrix to the beam matrix:
\begin{equation}
	\bm{\sigma}_1 = \mathcal{M}\;\bm{\sigma}_0\;\mathcal{M}^T
	\label{eq:apply}
\end{equation}
where \(\bm{\sigma}_0\) is the initial beam matrix, \(\mathcal{M}\) is the
transport matrix of the beam line and \(\bm{\sigma}_1\) is the beam matrix at
the end of the beam line.
